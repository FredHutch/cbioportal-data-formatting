## Useful tools 

This part of the repository contains curated tools that can be helpful to prepare different types of files in formats that can be uploaded into cBioportal. 

## What you will find here 

You will find each tool in a separate folder. Within this folder there will be a readme with detailed instructions on how to use the tool, an overview of how the folder is structured and an example study that you can use as a template to test the tool. Those folders that have a number preceding their folder name have been tested by us (Example: 01_Data_processor). We will keep updating these as we test the tools, so visit back for updates on these tools.
